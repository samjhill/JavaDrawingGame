so say, both client and server have its own thread

can it run with another thread?


Yes, You may need to do a little bit of concurrency, or the simple way...

If the only thing that is running is a Java GUI and the thread pulling/sending objects you can use
the stuff below in the receving thread.


SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {

	public void run() {

		//Code that you want to run in the same thread as the UI.
		//This prevents any concurrency glitches without introducing too much complexity.
	}
});
